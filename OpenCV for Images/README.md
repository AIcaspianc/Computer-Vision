## **OpenCV**
- **OpenCV** is a huge open-source **library** for **computer vision**, **machine learning**, and **image processing**.
-  It can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even human handwriting.
- It can also be integrated with other libraries such as **Numpy** (Python), which are capable of processing the OpenCV array structure.
- OpenCV is used to identify image patterns and various features of the image, by using vector space and performing mathematical operations on these features.


### Here we will cover the following topics:
- Reading an image.
- Displaying the shape of an image.
- Saving the image.
- Resizing the image.
- Conversion of the image to grayscale.
- Extracting the RGB values of a pixel.
- Adjusting Brightness and Contrast.
- Gaussian Blurring to reduce the noise of an image.
- Images as a multidimensional array.






### We would encourage you to first go through the functions and operations discussed below, and then try to implement and practise the same on other images.
