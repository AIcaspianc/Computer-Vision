**Computer Vision: COVID-19 Image Classification**

Problem Statement

Context

**Covid-19** is a fast-growing disease that affects human health severly. Patients diagonised with this condition suffers from lung infection. The medical community has recently released vaccines which have a slower effect in increasing the immunity. This virus has impacted various countries' human health and financial standing.

Deep learning algorithms have recently used image classification to identify medical images. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can be widely utilized to identify COVID-19 to assist radiologists in medical analysis by classifying patients who are healthy, have viral pneumonia, or are affected by COVID using X-ray pictures of the lungs.

**Objective**

The aim of this project is to Build a Convolutional Neural Network to differentiate an X-ray image of a person affected with covid from that of a healthy person or a person who has viral pneumonia(fever).

Data Dictionary

- This dataset contains training set images of 3 classes which are converted into numpy arrays.
- The dataset comprises 3 classes:
  - COVID-19: The patient who is effected due to covid.
  - Viral Pneumonia: This is a viral fever which has similar characteristics like fever and cought that of Covid but is not covid.
  - Normal- A healthy Person with no symptoms of covid or fever.
- The data file formats are:
  - npy
  - csv
